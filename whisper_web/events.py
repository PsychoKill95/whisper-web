    The EventBus provides a publish-subscribe pattern that enables loose coupling between
    different components of the whisper-web transcription system. Components can subscribe
    to specific event types and publish events without direct knowledge of other components.

    **Key Features:**

    - **Type-Safe Subscriptions**: Events are registered by their concrete type
    - **Async/Sync Handler Support**: Automatically detects and handles both coroutine and regular functions
    - **Multiple Subscribers**: Multiple handlers can subscribe to the same event type
    - **Decoupled Architecture**: Publishers don't need to know about subscribers
